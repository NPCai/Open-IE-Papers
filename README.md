## General <a name="general"></a>

This README containts OpenIE papers and resources. Summaries are by [@jbecke](https://github.com/jbecke) and [@TheodoreChristakis](https://github.com/TheodoreChristakis), to the best of our abilities after reading each paper or testing the system (when available). We welcome pull requests with additional resources, papers, or data.

* [Wikipedia OpenIE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_information_extraction)

## Literature Reviews <a name="reviews"></a>

* [A Survey on Open Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05599). Most up-to-date literature review (June 2018), convering non-neural network based approaches to OpenIE. Whereas I've classified by age in this document, the authors classify by method of extraction (learning-based, rule-based, clause-based, inter-propositional).

* [Creating a Large Benchmark for Open Information Extraction](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1252): summarizes the field and creates a benchmark for OpenIE systems and creates the first large benchmark dataset (note: not large enough to train NN's). 

## Papers - Neural Networks <a name="papers_nn"></a>

* [Neural Open Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04270.pdf): AFAIK, the first use of ANNs (seq2seq with attention) applied to OpenIE. Author bootstrapped tuples from high-confidence OpenIE-4 and makes the data available. However, the data isn't very clean; a quick glance shows a lot of malformed/incorrect tuples.

* [Supervised Open Information Extraction](http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1081): expands on the idea of turning QA datasets into OpenIE datasets. Trains an ANN with using an interesting feature representation, uses seq2seq model to generate BIO tags and then creates tuples from that using a deterministic algorithm.

## Papers - Traditional Methods <a name="papers_traditional"></a>

* [Stanford Open IE](https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/openie.html): it's great for maximally-shortened tuples. Cons: it seems to often produce nonsensical tuples for which the reported confidience is often 1.0. GPL or proprietary available as part of [Stanford Core NLP](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/).
* [OpenIE-X](https://knowitall.github.io/openie/) ([v4](https://github.com/knowitall/openie), [v5](https://github.com/dair-iitd/OpenIE-standalone), [allen institute version](https://github.com/allenai/openie-standalone)). From UW, this is the best traditional OpenIE system I've tried. Works well with simple statements (see examples [in this dataset](http://data.allenai.org/tuple-ie/)). Outputs context for extractions and gives good-enough confidence predictions that can be used to balance precision-recall. Note the restrictive license (research purposes only). 

## Papers - Older papers and legacy systems <a name="papers_old"></a>

* From University of Washington
  * [TextRunner](http://turing.cs.washington.edu/papers/ijcai07.pdf) - One of the earliest papers addressing open information extraction
  * [Reverb](http://reverb.cs.washington.edu/) - Improved the extraction to better form the tuple of (argument, relation, argument)
  * [OLLIE](https://knowitall.github.io/ollie/) - Addressed the issue of misleading propositions and non-verb mediated relations
* [CSD-IE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6693511/) - Generation of nested contractions which is especially effective in sentences using subordinating clauses
* [PropS](http://u.cs.biu.ac.il/~stanovg/props.html): Syntax Based Proposition Extraction
* [ClausIE](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/databases-and-information-systems/software/clausie/) - Formed a strong relation between grammatical clauses, propositions, and OIE extractions by defining seven grammatical patterns
* [ReNoun](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1038) - Used predominantly for noun-mediated relations.

## Training and Testing Data <a name="data"></a>

* [35M sentence-tuple pairs](https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=c826c2d6f4c7d993&id=C826C2D6F4C7D993%213193&authkey=!AHj1kHDE5TSS0e8): from the paper [Neural Open Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.04270.pdf). It was generated by OpenIE-4, removing any tuples less then 0.9 confidence. Because there is no sample data, I've copied a bit below. As you can see, the data is somewhat noisy. It *might* be useful for extra training data, but not as a gold dataset.

* [TupleInf Open IE Dataset](http://data.allenai.org/tuple-ie/): OpenIE-4 extractions of 8th grade and 4th grade questions. By inspection, these tend to be cleaner than the above dataset because of the simplicity of the language. Confidence-values are retained so you can make your own tradeoff between precision and recall. Note suitable for a gold dataset.

* [Squadie](https://github.com/NPCai/Squadie) (not yet published, expect changes): this is our dataset derived from Squad. It uses a similar JSON format to SQuAD and contains 50,000 tuples, almost an order of magnitude more than previous systems. From each question we extract a tuple. This tuple can then be matched with the corresponding sentence in the training corpus. Not suitable as a gold corpus.
